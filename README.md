# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>

<hr>
<p>My name is Stefan Bayne, and I'm currently a software engineer! <br>
I enjoy creating apps with Android development, playing around with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS <br>
for Web Development, and exloring the world of Linux, Version Control, etc. with DevOps! I am<br>
truly passionate about creating applications with Kotlin and Java, and integrating new technologies<br>
into my applications as often as possible. I'm always looking to further my knowledge, receive <br>
constructive criticism, and learn from all of the connections I make. Hopefully one day I'll be<br>
able to relay the knowledge I've gained with others as well!</p>

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always looking to learn as well as help if I can.
